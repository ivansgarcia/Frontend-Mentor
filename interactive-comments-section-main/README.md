## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this exercise I used the React framework GatsbyJS for create the webpage with TailwindCSS for apply styles to it.

I created it with the Mobile-first workflow.

You can create new comments, edit and delete them. Also you can upvote a comment and undo this.
The app saves the new comments date and shows the passed time since it was posted.
