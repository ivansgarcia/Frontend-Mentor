## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

In this exercise I learned to manage the modiffication of the html elements using Javascript.
The use of JS to manage the input data to show error messages and the use of media-queries to adapt the page to different screen sizes.

### Continued development

In next projects will be better to use some style processors.
