## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

For this exercise I used the React framework GatsbyJS with TailwindCSS.
I used the Grid disposition for the keyboard of the calculator.
The app uses the React hooks useEffect and useState.
When open the app, this checks your color scheme (dark or light) of your browser and applies the corresponding style.
(* In Google Chrome this feature doesn't work and shows always light theme).
And on changing the color theme it saves in the local storage.
