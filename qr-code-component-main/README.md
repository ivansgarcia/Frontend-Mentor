## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

The use of relative sizes to adapt the web to different screen sizes.
```css
  .container {
    max-width: 330px;
    width: 80%;
  }
```
To center elements using position and transform attributes.
```css
  .container {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  }
```
To import fonts from Google Fonts.
```css
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&family=Ubuntu:wght 290;400;500;700&display=swap');

```

### Continued development

In future exercises I will use css processors for style the html.
